- Open pull requests for all major changes and request reviews.
- Document any architectural decisions in the project wiki.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Run the full test suite before pushing changes.

## Security

- Use environment variables for configuration.

## Communication
- Use the issue tracker for bugs and feature requests.
- Discuss major changes with the team before implementation.
